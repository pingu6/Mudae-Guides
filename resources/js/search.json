[[{"l":"Welcome"}],[{"l":"A Message to Readers","p":["I am PRCSakura/UberMillennium RailgunPro, the author of this manual. I have decided to write this comprehensive manual to aid players who want to dig deep through the bot and learn its mechanics. Although this document will not contain parts that I don’t deem worthy enough to explain/walkthrough.","To the new players, welcome to Mudae. To veteran players, you might know most of the mechanics or you want to read this manual for pleasure.","What does the original doc look like? I have decided to completely revamp + relocate this entire document into a manual and other purposes, as I took Mudae too seriously back then. This was back then. Embarrassing yes, although some of them still apply to me nowadays."]}],[{"l":"What is even Mudae","p":["Ahem. What’s Mudae really? It is a Discord game bot where you collect characters. This is the Discord game bot where you collect characters (even though they are PNG’s that represent the characters) from anime, manga, games, comics, books, movies, TV’s and even IRL figures. While there are no explicit rules written, it is however strongly encouraged to be fair with other players. Your server, your rules.","Most of the common questions/tips are answered in Mudae Wiki, but I will include some based on my personal experiences. For new players, some of the basic walkthroughs are found in $tuto (although it does not cover everything that you will need to know). For other command assistance, type $help and the bot will DM you each commands’ purposes.","Commands you will use are italicized for better clarification."]}],[{"l":"Starting from Scratch","p":["Bronze 1 (wishing slot) and Silver 1 (wish spawn bonus) to unlock Sapphire.","Bronze 2, Silver 2, Gold 2, Ruby 4. Then max the rest of the badges the order as you please.","Emerald 1(not needed but a nice bonus when maxing badges). It is a spare claim (the command for it is $rt) that can be used once per 50 hours. At level 4, the cooldown is reduced to 20 hours once used (can reduce to 5 hours with KL). Even with Emerald 4, use your backup power (my personal Mudae vocabulary that means $rt) with caution.","Even if this is the most optimal route to take, there are other routes depending on the players’ goal, the current status in the server etc.","For players who are starting from scratch, the order for kakera badges, you should aim for:","Gold IV is, if not the most important part to start when maxing badges. Gold reduces the cost for reacting. At full level, you will reduce the reaction cost to 60%","I just started Mudae from scratch and I want to get those boosts, but I’m penniless.","If by default price, you want to earn at least 200 grands in total before restarting.","If by the lowest values (in this case, 1 grand as base price), then at least 40 grands are needed before restarting.","Now, this is when you should upgrade the badge by the cheapest route:","Once you earnt enough kakera, type $kakerarefund (restarts your badges and get your invested kakeras back). It is an admin-restricted command by default, but anyone who has the perm can type $setpermission kakerarefund charowner can remove such restriction.","Once you have maxed badges, you may proceed to the next step for boosting your kakera farming production further.","One you unlock Sapphire, max that too. At full level, cyan and blue kakeras are replaced by yellow kakera (it gives at least 400 kaks per reaction, more if using slash and other kakera-boosting bonuses).","Refer to $kr (only if you are new to Mudae).","Ruby IV: A combination of 4 other badges (except Emerald) but each of them are equivalent to level 2. Maxed Ruby reduces the badge cost by 1/4 (useful when you restart your badges).","Warning: It is server admins’/owners’ discretion to use $setpermission kakerarefund charowner. Never pressure any server admins/owners if they refuse to. If $kakerarefund is not possible, be sure to use the cheapest route (start with Gold II, then Gold IV after Ruby IV). Refer to $badgevalue."]}],[{"l":"Kakera Tower","p":["Kakera Tower is one of the features we spend kakeras on almost immediately after badges. They give several different types of bonuses and give additional boosts during your Mudae journey. Although there are a dozen of unique bonuses, there are quite few of them that are high-priority (meaning which floor to build 1st).","Contrary to the description + popular belief, Kakera Tower is not infinite. The limit is 74 full towers and 5 floors on the 75th tower (or 2 billion kakeras invested). To most players, it is a mountainous task to achieve and it is likely to have few full towers built during their journey.","There are debates of which bonuses to start with, thus there is no single “best route”, all depending on your goal and other bonuses.","Floor 7/8 specializes in kakera production boost. Having them both however, synergize well with each other. Although it is debated which one is the best to start with. Floor 7 gives 10% more power (5% on Tower 2 and capping at 480% at 75th tower), best for players who don’t roll often. Floor 8 gives a kakera reaction cost -4% kakera power (-2% until Tower 4), suitable for frequent rollers and don’t want to wait long.","Floor 3 specializes in pool-size reduction, although they differ.","On mode 1, each tower’s Floor 3 gives 1 additional disablelist slot and overlap limits are scaled by the number of characters in the database. Floor 3 is the only way to gain additional slots aside from Player Premium, while KL does too, gives overlap limit boosts, thus slots are valued higher than overlap limit especially for non-Prem players. Even for Premium players, having those bonuses can provide additional damage boosts to their DL. For mode 1 main, it is one of the highest priority to complete.","On mode 2, it gives additional limroul boosts (-200 animanga/-100 game, -100 animanga/-50 games on Tower 2 and beyond). Even with a not-so-significant boost, it doesn’t rely on RNG for it to work.","Floor 10 specializes on Light kakera boost (a miscellaneous kakera that contains 3-4 random kakeras if reacted by default). Yes, Light has a chance of containing orange/red/rainbow albeit low droprate. To some players, Floor 10 is one of the top priority."]}],[{"l":"Kakera Loot","p":["Should I aim for KL or KT after maxed badges?","Build Kakera Towers 1st. Like, a bunch of them.","Eventually, you can buy KLs. It's highly advised to level up your $quality & $quantity to level 100 before loots.","Usually, the bare minimum before using $destroy is three full towers: 36 floors is 3,330,000 Kakera, and the price of quality and quantity levels 100 is 2,380,000 Kakera (and to cover the cost for 1000 loots after $quantity 100 and $quality 100). However, it will cripple you for a significant amount of time if using the “3 Towers then KL strat”, and it will take longer to get back on your feet when you do not have any KT perks. I highly advise you to build at least 4-5 full towers before using KLs. While it takes significantly longer (usually 2x longer) to get to such goals, you can, however, recover much quicker afterward.","Once you hit a thousand KLs used, you may feel free to build back the towers you lost or keep KL’ing.","If you bought any KLs before $quantity 100 and $quality 100 at some point, it is advised to stop right where you are and save up for max qual + quan.","Warning: Using $klreset is not recommended (even though I personally did it b/c of my messed up KLs) as it will nuke your whole KL without receiving a refund and it is considered to be wasting kakeras."]}],[{"i":"middle-late-to-endgame-strategies","l":"Middle, late to endgame strategies","p":["Perhaps you already know the strats for farming kakeras during early game and you want to push it further.","At this point, $bku + kakera reactions from wishlists are the main engines for farming (assume you can roll keys consistently).","Having kakera-collecting alts can help, although this is a 2x edged sword:","Warning: Such a strategy might get frowned upon in a multiplayer server or even jeopardize your accounts getting kicked + banned from the server (notably Rollsdae World)! Always refer to your server’s rules + ask for permissions before bringing your alts!","Conversely, they are godsend for your solo/personal server, as they can clean up yellow or orange kakeras from your rolls and transfer them to your main account periodically.","To utilize kakera-collecting alts, it is recommended to have their badges maxed just like your main account.","There is a slight twist, their KT only has floor 7 and 8 (and optionally 10th/11th) built.","Have their $bk set to 5 (it nets 20% boost from kakera reacting, stacks independently with slash and Premium). Even though this is me on Rollsdae World, not my personal server.","You can utilize $bitesthedust requiem (works like divorce except they are restore-able via $restore) if you are the owner or having the perms. Note, once you use the command, there is a 300 hour cooldown (equivalent to 15 days) and it is shared with $thanosall requiem, or with the scrap suffix.","Warning: Be sure to use $cd allrolls before using Requiem. If any characters who were in the $restorelist gets claimed right after, $restoreuser will not take effect and will have to restore one character at a time.","For endgame scenarios (mainly for hundreds of thousands to millions of KLs used and dozens of towers or even capped), if a particular character (usually hi-profiles) has a bunch of keys on them (tens of thousands to millions), you can use them to claim + divorce strat. Make sure that you can maintain your mode 1 DL/limroul and $sdl to roll them really often.","To soup up their value to the extreme, have friends/alts to claim random characters with you.","If you can spend some IRL cash monthly, you can choose Server Premium 1/2. Such perk allows everyone in the entire server to claim once per 120/60 minutes via $setclaim 120 or $setclaim 60 respectively (in addition, more hourly rolls and spawns less claimed characters via $setrare 6 or $setrare 10)."]}]]
