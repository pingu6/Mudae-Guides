order: 100

I just started Mudae from scratch and I want to get those boosts, but I’m penniless.

For players who are starting from scratch, the order for kakera badges, you should aim for:

Refer to $kr (only if you are new to Mudae).

Gold IV is, if not the most important part to start when maxing badges. Gold reduces the cost for reacting. At full level, you will reduce the reaction cost to 60%

Bronze 1 (wishing slot) and Silver 1 (wish spawn bonus) to unlock Sapphire.

One you unlock Sapphire, max that too. At full level, cyan and blue kakeras are replaced by yellow kakera (it gives at least 400 kaks per reaction, more if using slash and other kakera-boosting bonuses).

Ruby IV: A combination of 4 other badges (except Emerald) but each of them are equivalent to level 2. Maxed Ruby reduces the badge cost by 1/4 (useful when you restart your badges).

Emerald 1(not needed but a nice bonus when maxing badges). It is a spare claim (the command for it is $rt) that can be used once per 50 hours. At level 4, the cooldown is reduced to 20 hours once used (can reduce to 5 hours with KL). Even with Emerald 4, use your backup power (my personal Mudae vocabulary that means $rt) with caution.

Once you earnt enough kakera, type $kakerarefund (restarts your badges and get your invested kakeras back). It is an admin-restricted command by default, but anyone who has the perm can type $setpermission kakerarefund charowner can remove such restriction.

If by default price, you want to earn at least 200 grands in total before restarting.

If by the lowest values (in this case, 1 grand as base price), then at least 40 grands are needed before restarting.

Now, this is when you should upgrade the badge by the cheapest route:

Bronze 2, Silver 2, Gold 2, Ruby 4. Then max the rest of the badges the order as you please.

!!!
Warning: It is server admins’/owners’ discretion to use $setpermission kakerarefund charowner. Never pressure any server admins/owners if they refuse to. If $kakerarefund is not possible, be sure to use the cheapest route (start with Gold II, then Gold IV after Ruby IV). Refer to $badgevalue.
!!!

Once you have maxed badges, you may proceed to the next step for boosting your kakera farming production further.

Even if this is the most optimal route to take, there are other routes depending on the players’ goal, the current status in the server etc.
