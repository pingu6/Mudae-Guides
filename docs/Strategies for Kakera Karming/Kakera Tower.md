Kakera Tower is one of the features we spend kakeras on almost immediately after badges. They give [several different types](https://mudae.fandom.com/wiki/Kakera_Tower) of bonuses and give additional boosts during your Mudae journey. Although there are a dozen of unique bonuses, there are quite few of them that are high-priority (meaning which floor to build 1st).

Contrary to the description + popular belief, Kakera Tower is not infinite. The limit is 74 full towers and 5 floors on the 75th tower (or 2 billion kakeras invested). To most players, it is a mountainous task to achieve and it is likely to have few full towers built during their journey.

There are debates of which bonuses to start with, thus there is no single “best route”, all depending on your goal and other bonuses.
  - Floor 7/8 specializes in kakera production boost. Having them both however, synergize well with each other. Although it is debated which one is the best to start with. Floor 7 gives 10% more power (5% on Tower 2 and capping at 480% at 75th tower), best for players who don’t roll often. Floor 8 gives a kakera reaction cost -4% kakera power (-2% until Tower 4), suitable for frequent rollers and don’t want to wait long.

  - Floor 3 specializes in pool-size reduction, although they differ.

    - On mode 1, each tower’s Floor 3 gives 1 additional disablelist slot and overlap limits are scaled by the number of characters in the database. Floor 3 is the only way to gain additional slots aside from Player Premium, while KL does too, gives overlap limit boosts, thus slots are valued higher than overlap limit especially for non-Prem players. Even for Premium players, having those bonuses can provide additional damage boosts to their DL. For mode 1 main, it is one of the highest priority to complete.

    - On mode 2, it gives additional limroul boosts (-200 animanga/-100 game, -100 animanga/-50 games on Tower 2 and beyond). Even with a not-so-significant boost, it doesn’t rely on RNG for it to work.

  - Floor 10 specializes on Light kakera boost (a miscellaneous kakera that contains 3-4 random kakeras if reacted by default). Yes, Light has a chance of containing orange/red/rainbow albeit low droprate. To some players, Floor 10 is one of the top priority.
