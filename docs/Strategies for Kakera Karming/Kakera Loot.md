Should I aim for KL or KT after maxed badges?
  - Build Kakera Towers 1st. Like, a bunch of them.

  - Eventually, you can buy KLs. It's highly advised to level up your $quality & $quantity to level 100 before loots.

  - Usually, the bare minimum before using $destroy is three full towers: 36 floors is 3,330,000 Kakera, and the price of quality and quantity levels 100 is 2,380,000 Kakera (and to cover the cost for 1000 loots after $quantity 100 and $quality 100). However, it will cripple you for a significant amount of time if using the “3 Towers then KL strat”, and it will take longer to get back on your feet when you do not have any KT perks. I highly advise you to build at least 4-5 full towers before using KLs. While it takes significantly longer (usually 2x longer) to get to such goals, you can, however, recover much quicker afterward.

  - Once you hit a thousand KLs used, you may feel free to build back the towers you lost or keep KL’ing.

  - If you bought any KLs before $quantity 100 and $quality 100 at some point, it is advised to stop right where you are and save up for max qual + quan.

!!!
Warning: Using $klreset is not recommended (even though I personally did it b/c of my messed up KLs) as it will nuke your whole KL without receiving a refund and it is considered to be wasting kakeras.
