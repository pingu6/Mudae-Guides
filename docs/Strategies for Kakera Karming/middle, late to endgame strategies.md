Perhaps you already know the strats for farming kakeras during early game and you want to push it further.
  - At this point, $bku + kakera reactions from wishlists are the main engines for farming (assume you can roll keys consistently).

  - Having kakera-collecting alts can help, although this is a 2x edged sword:

    !!!
      Warning: Such a strategy might get frowned upon in a multiplayer server or even jeopardize your accounts getting kicked + banned from the server (notably Rollsdae World)! Always refer to your serverâ€™s rules + ask for permissions before bringing your alts!
    !!!

    - Conversely, they are godsend for your solo/personal server, as they can clean up yellow or orange kakeras from your rolls and transfer them to your main account periodically.

    - To utilize kakera-collecting alts, it is recommended to have their badges maxed just like your main account.

    - There is a slight twist, their KT only has floor 7 and 8 (and optionally 10th/11th) built.

    - Have their $bk set to 5 (it nets 20% boost from kakera reacting, stacks independently with slash and Premium). Even though this is me on Rollsdae World, not my personal server.

    - You can utilize $bitesthedust requiem (works like divorce except they are restore-able via $restore) if you are the owner or having the perms. Note, once you use the command, there is a 300 hour cooldown (equivalent to 15 days) and it is shared with $thanosall requiem, or with the scrap suffix.

      !!!
      Warning: Be sure to use $cd allrolls before using Requiem. If any characters who were in the $restorelist gets claimed right after, $restoreuser will not take effect and will have to restore one character at a time.
      !!!

    - For endgame scenarios (mainly for hundreds of thousands to millions of KLs used and dozens of towers or even capped), if a particular character (usually hi-profiles) has a bunch of keys on them (tens of thousands to millions), you can use them to claim + divorce strat. Make sure that you can maintain your mode 1 DL/limroul and $sdl to roll them really often.

      - To soup up their value to the extreme, have friends/alts to claim random characters with you.

      - If you can spend some IRL cash monthly, you can choose Server Premium 1/2. Such perk allows everyone in the entire server to claim once per 120/60 minutes via $setclaim 120 or $setclaim 60 respectively (in addition, more hourly rolls and spawns less claimed characters via $setrare 6 or $setrare 10).
