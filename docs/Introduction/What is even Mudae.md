Ahem. What’s Mudae really? It is a Discord game bot where you collect characters. This is the Discord game bot where you collect characters (even though they are PNG’s that represent the characters) from anime, manga, games, comics, books, movies, TV’s and even IRL figures. While there are no explicit rules written, it is however strongly encouraged to be fair with other players. Your server, your rules.

Most of the common questions/tips are answered in [Mudae Wiki](https://mudae.fandom.com/wiki/FAQs), but I will include some based on my personal experiences. For new players, some of the basic walkthroughs are found in $tuto (although it does not cover everything that you will need to know). For other command assistance, type $help and the bot will DM you each commands’ purposes.

*Commands you will use are italicized for better clarification*.
