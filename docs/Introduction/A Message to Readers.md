I am PRCSakura/UberMillennium RailgunPro, the author of this manual. I have decided to write this comprehensive manual to aid players who want to dig deep through the bot and learn its mechanics. Although this document will not contain parts that I donâ€™t deem worthy enough to explain/walkthrough.

To the new players, welcome to Mudae. To veteran players, you might know most of the mechanics or you want to read this manual for pleasure.

What does the original doc look like?
I have decided to completely revamp + relocate this entire document into a manual and other purposes, as I took Mudae too seriously back then. [This was back then](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14R0ujSJfe-ScKyl78eq3kDwnW4GCnZqG9xMTQN0O6Z0/edit). Embarrassing yes, although some of them still apply to me nowadays.
